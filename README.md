# melody-generation-from-lyrics
Repository to implement techniques to generate melody conditioned on lyrics


## Step 1. Creating the embeddings
The first step is to create embeddings for each syllable / word which would be 
fed into the following LSTM-GAN model.

We create a simple feed-forward network to create the embeddings

Model:
- Layer 1
- Layer 2
